                    <h4>About Myself</h4>
                    My name is Rowan Strafford and I am a graduate student from Solent University having just recently finished my Computer Games (Software Development) BSc degree.         
                    <p class="pBreak"><br></p>
                    My main interest for programming would be in the field of Artificial intelligence where a 3D space is controlled. A project I had in mind involves the minipulation of objects using cameras within an area. I feel my path for achieving this could be taken down either a games route or a software development one. 
                    <p class="pBreak"><br></p>
                    I feel confident in myself to produce work to meet a certain standard while remaining open to others opinions and ideas as well as my own. I am hoping my capacity to think of unique routes to solve goals and fix problems aids me in my development.

                <h3>Current Project</h3>
                <li>- A Multiplayer Mobile Unity project working with Nav Meshes. This project has allowed me to gain an insight into how agents can be moved around a scene without the use of any input whilst also pushing and pulling data to and from a server to update entity information. The implementation for this project is nearly complete with a working protype ready to be tested. I plan on releasing this game to the Android mobile app store.</li>

                <h3>Recent Projects</h3>
                <li>- My most recent project involved the research, planning, design and implementation of a Behaviour Tree using C++ and DirectX 11. The project was a success as it allowed me to understand several different AI concepts including Machine Learning, Entity Flocking, Pathfinding and of course creating a Behaviour Tree. </li>
                <li>- Another project that I worked on recently was a demo for some advanced rendering techniques using DirectX 11 and C++. The project shows the processes that were used such as depth buffering, 3D object rendering and using lighting as well as demonstrating how an .obj model importer is used. </li>
